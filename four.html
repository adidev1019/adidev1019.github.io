<font color="white" size="5"><p>On June 24, 2010, The Indian cricket team defeated Sri Lanka in their own backyard to win the Asia Cup.

What made it more special was the fact that we won the title for the first time since 1995. The match was pretty one-sided. After posting 268/6, MS Dhoni's boys restricted the Lankans to 187. The 81-run win pretty much proved the difference between the two sides.
But guess the mood back home. How did they celebrate? Well, actually they did not. Why? Because nobody noticed!

So the question arises why a nation crazy for cricket was not paying attention to such a big win? The answer lies in the beautiful game. Yes, the FIFA World Cup was going on and for that period of one month even cricket took a back seat in India.</p>
